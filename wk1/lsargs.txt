my favourite ls args

-a dotfiles and current directory listed as well
-l more readable format + permissions, sizes etc.
-h if intrested in filesizes
-R sometimes useful for small directory trees
-S 
-t userful for finding recently edited files
-r reverse order

--color=auto
rarely useful, but nice

my ls alias:
alias ls='ls -al --color=auto -h'
